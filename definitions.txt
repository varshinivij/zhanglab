Zero shot classification: allows the model to classify the input as a specific label, 
without any prior training on those specific labels

Requires a deeper understanding of the context and description of the classes from NLP.
(Aka, understands that a zebra is a stripped four legged animal)

Understands patterns in images
(Learns what a stripped animal may look like)

Hence, when given an image of a zebra, whose labels or images it may not have recieved during training, it is able to classify it.
Zero-shot is possible because knowledge is compositional
